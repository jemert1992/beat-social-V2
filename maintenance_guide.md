# OAuth Implementation Maintenance Guide

This guide provides instructions for maintaining and supporting the OAuth implementation for TikTok and Instagram integration in your Social Media Automation System.

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Token Refresh Monitoring

OAuth tokens have expiration periods that require regular refreshing:

- **TikTok tokens**: Typically expire after 24 hours
- **Instagram tokens**: Long-lived tokens expire after 60 days

Implement a scheduled task to:
- Check for tokens nearing expiration (e.g., within 24 hours)
- Automatically trigger the refresh process
- Log any refresh failures for immediate attention

```python
# Example cron job (run daily)
from services.token_service import TokenStorageService
from services.tiktok_service import TikTokService
from services.instagram_service import InstagramService
from models import SocialAccount, OAuthToken
import logging

def refresh_expiring_tokens():
    """Refresh tokens that are about to expire."""
    token_service = TokenStorageService()
    tiktok_service = TikTokService(token_service)
    instagram_service = InstagramService(token_service)
    
    # Get all tokens from the database
    expiring_tokens = OAuthToken.query.filter(OAuthToken.is_expired()).all()
    
    for token in expiring_tokens:
        account = SocialAccount.query.get(token.account_id)
        if not account or not account.is_active:
            continue
            
        if account.platform == 'tiktok':
            result = tiktok_service.refresh_account_token(account.id)
        elif account.platform == 'instagram':
            result = instagram_service.refresh_account_token(account.id)
        
        if not result['success']:
            logging.error(f"Failed to refresh token for {account.platform} account {account.username}: {result.get('error')}")
```

### 2. Database Maintenance

- Regularly backup the database (daily recommended)
- Implement a cleanup process for inactive accounts (e.g., deactivated for >90 days)
- Monitor database size and performance

### 3. Security Updates

- Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions
- Regularly rotate encryption keys (every 90 days recommended)
- Monitor for security advisories related to OAuth implementations

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Token Refresh Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Users unable to post content
- API requests returning authentication errors

**Solutions:**
- Check if the platform's API is operational
- Verify that client credentials (client key/secret) are still valid
- Manually trigger a token refresh
- If persistent, guide the user to disconnect and reconnect the account

### 2. Account Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- OAuth flow fails to complete
- Callback errors

**Solutions:**
- Verify redirect URIs are correctly configured in both your app and the platform's developer portal
- Check for API permission changes or scope requirements
- Ensure the user has granted all required permissions
- Check rate limits on the platform side

### 3. Database Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow performance
- Connection errors

**Solutions:**
- Check database connection settings
- Verify database size and implement cleanup if necessary
- Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried fields

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement comprehensive monitoring:

1. **API Request Logging**
   - Track all API requests to social platforms
   - Log response times and error rates
   - Set up alerts for unusual error patterns

2. **User Activity Monitoring**
   - Track account connections and disconnections
   - Monitor posting activity
   - Identify patterns of failed operations

3. **System Health Checks**
   - Regular database connection tests
   - Token encryption verification
   - API availability checks

## Platform Policy Compliance

Stay updated with platform policies:

1. **TikTok Developer Policies**
   - Regularly check for updates at [TikTok for Developers](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/overview-policy-guideline/)
   - Ensure your implementation complies with content posting guidelines
   - Monitor for changes to API rate limits or authentication methods

2. **Instagram Platform Policy**
   - Review updates at [Instagram Platform Policy](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/overview/#instagram-platform-policy)
   - Ensure proper disclosure of data usage
   - Comply with content publishing guidelines

## Scaling Considerations

As your user base grows:

1. **Database Scaling**
   - Consider sharding strategies for the token database
   - Implement read replicas for high-traffic deployments

2. **API Rate Limit Management**
   - Implement token bucket algorithms for rate limiting
   - Queue posting requests during high-volume periods
   - Distribute requests across multiple accounts when possible

3. **Caching Strategies**
   - Cache account information to reduce API calls
   - Implement token caching with proper invalidation strategies

## Backup and Recovery

Implement a robust backup strategy:

1. **Database Backups**
   - Daily full backups
   - Hourly incremental backups
   - Test restoration procedures regularly

2. **Configuration Backups**
   - Maintain backups of all OAuth application configurations
   - Document all redirect URIs and callback settings

3. **Disaster Recovery Plan**
   - Document steps to recover from complete system failure
   - Include procedures for re-establishing OAuth connections

## User Support Guidelines

When assisting users:

1. **Account Connection Issues**
   - Guide users through the connection process step by step
   - Provide screenshots of expected permission screens
   - Explain what permissions are being requested and why

2. **Token Expiration Issues**
   - Explain the concept of token expiration in simple terms
   - Provide clear instructions for reconnecting accounts
   - Implement a notification system for users with expired tokens

3. **Content Posting Failures**
   - Help users understand platform-specific content guidelines
   - Provide troubleshooting steps for common posting errors
   - Implement detailed error messages that suggest specific actions

## Future Enhancements

Consider these enhancements for future updates:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Add additional security for admin users
   - Protect access to connected social accounts

2. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Track token usage and refresh patterns
   - Monitor account performance metrics
   - Provide insights on optimal posting times

3. **Webhook Integration**
   - Implement webhooks for real-time notifications of token issues
   - Set up automated alerts for critical authentication failures

4. **Admin Dashboard Improvements**
   - Add visual indicators for token health
   - Implement bulk operations for account management
   - Create detailed audit logs for all OAuth-related activities
